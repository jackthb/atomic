To be honest, I'd be flying carry-on only too, if I didn't have so many liquids.

I don't think that's justification to be so prickly with the flight attendants though.

Context:
I was at ATL waiting for an already delayed flight back to London and a flight attendant was asking people with large carry-on luggage to move it into the hold so they had more room.
