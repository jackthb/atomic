This is my personal portfolio built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel. It is my home base, and something I am working on constantly. The design is loosely inspired by Atomic Habits by James Clear, as my growth as a developer is directly influenced by the habits I build to ensure I am constantly learning.

It uses Tailwind CSS for design, and a notion-api for the CMS of my projects. In future, it will house a blog that I can use for my adventures in life more generally.

To run:

`npm run dev`
