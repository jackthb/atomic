auth0-todo is a very minimal to-do app built with TailwindCSS, Airtable, and auth0. In order to learn more authentication and protected routes, I followed a tutorial to build a simple app that allows logging in via a multitude of platforms, and figured out the mechanisms behind it. Afterwards I put my own spin on the styling and added a few features.
