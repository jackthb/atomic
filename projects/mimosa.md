mimosa is a mobile-first web application designed for RSVPing to events, created during the Queens Jubilee with my roommate. The app is built using Next.js and Firebase.

The app enables event organizers to create events and generate shareable links that can be sent to friends. Attendees can  RSVP to these events without the need for creating an account. By providing their name and optionally their Instagram handle, guests can personalize their RSVP experience with their display pictures being scraped from their Instagram profiles.
