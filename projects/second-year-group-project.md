## Griffon

![login screen for griffon](https://i.imgur.com/pTaMzmR.png)

Griffon was a group project taken in my second year of university along with 4 other group members. We were tasked with building an application from scratch, from design to implementation. I took up the lead role for the Frontend side of the development, taking responsbility for major sections of the Wallet, Exchange, Settings, and onboarding.

The Frontend is an Electron app written in React and the backend using Springboot written in Java.

The application is a mock cryptocurrency trading application. The users can make a fake e-wallet which they can use to convert to other supported currencies, listed below.
