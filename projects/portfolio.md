# What is Atomic?
Atomic is this website!

![homepage](https://res.cloudinary.com/du2zxsy39/image/upload/v1613949426/portfolio/7INoMac_se5dsz.png)

It's name is inspired by Tailwind CSS's inexplicably small production size, and one of my favourite books, [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits).

It is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It also uses Notion as a CMS, utilising react-notion and notion-api-worker.

This portfolio acts as a base for my work, with links to my GitHub and social platforms. It will also (eventually) house my blog which should receive frequent updates.
